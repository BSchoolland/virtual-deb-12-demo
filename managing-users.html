        <h2>Part 2: Managing users</h2>
        <p>Next, I wanted to test the multi-user capabilities of my new Debian-12 virtual machine. I created a new user named "testuser" and gave them sudo privileges. Here's how I did it:</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Install the sudo package</h3>
        <p>At first, sudo was not installed on the Debian-12 VM. Since I would need it, I elevated to root and installed it with the following commands:</p>
        <pre>
    su -
    apt install sudo
</pre>
        <h3>Step 2: Create a new user</h3>
        <p>Next (still running as root), I created a new user named "testuser" with the following command:</p>
        <pre>
    adduser testuser
</pre>
        <p>I was prompted to enter some information about the new user, such as their password and full name. I entered the information and the user was created.</p>
        <h3>Step 3: Add the new user to the sudo group</h3>
        <p>Finally, I decided to add this new user to the sudo group so that they could run commands with elevated privileges. I did this with the following command:</p>
        <pre>
    usermod -aG sudo testuser
</pre>
        <p>After this, I was able to reboot, log in as "testuser", and run commands with sudo, which was a great success. As you can see in the image below, I was able to install vim-nox with my newfound sudoer powers!  If only I could use vscode... ah the struggles of not having a GUI</p>
