        <h2>1. Creating a virtual Debian-12 machine</h2>
        <p>In this project, I'll show you how to create a virtual Debian-12 machine using the virt-manager tool. </p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>Please note that you'll need to be running linux, and have virt-manager installed. It will also help if you
            have a decent computer, if you're running this on a potato, it will be slow and you may have to alocate
            fewer resources to the virtual machine.</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Install virt-manager</h3>
        <p>First, you'll need to install virt-manager. You can do this by running the following commands:</p>
        <pre>
    sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-clients virt-manager  
    sudo apt install -y libvirt-daemon-system bridge-utils virtinst libvirt-daemon  
    sudo apt install -y qemu qemu-kvm qemu-system qemu-utils  
    sudo usermod -aG libvirt $(whoami)
    sudo usermod -aG libvirt-qemu $(whoami)</pre>
        <p>Note: The last two commands utilize the $(whoami) command to get the current user. You can also just enter
            your username if you want!</p>
        <h3>Step 2: Download the Debian-12 ISO</h3>
        <p>Next, you'll need to download the Debian-12 ISO. You can do this by visiting debian's official website at <a
                        href="https://www.debian.org/download" target="_blank">https://www.debian.org/download</a> and downloading the ISO. </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Create a new virtual machine</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Next, you'll need to create a new virtual machine. To do this, open virt-manager using
                <pre>
    virt-manager</pre> and click on the "Create a new virtual machine" button. The first question will ask you to select an
                installation method. Choose "Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)" and click "Forward".
            </li>
            <li>Next, you'll need to select the Debian-12 ISO that you downloaded earlier. Click "Browse" and navigate
                to the location of the ISO. Select the ISO and click "Choose Volume".</li>
            <li>virt-manager should automatically detect the operating system and version. If it doesn't, you can
                manually select "Linux" and "Debian 12" from the dropdown menus.</li>
            <li>Next, you'll need to allocate resources to the virtual machine. You can choose how much memory and CPU
                cores to allocate. For this demo, I'll allocate 4GB of memory (enter 4096) and 2 CPU cores. If you're
                running on the aforementioned potato, you may want to allocate fewer resources.</li>
            <li>Next, you'll need to allocate storage to the virtual machine. You can choose how much storage to
                allocate. 20GB should be plenty for this demo.</li>
            <li>Finally, you'll need to name the virtual machine and click "Finish". This will create and then start the
                virtual machine.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 4: Install Debian-12</h3>
        <p>I personally find the installation process to be pretty self-explanatory, and default options are almost
            always fine. If you don't need a complete walkthrough, you can skip this section. I've used the Install
            option, but feel free to use the Graphical Install option if you prefer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the virtual machine has started, you'll need to install Debian-12. Select the "Install" option
            </li>
            <li>Next, you'll need to select your language, location, and keyboard layout. The default options should be
                fine for most users. Press enter a couple of times to accept the defaults, then the installer will
                start.</li>
            <li>Next, you'll need to configure the network. Again, the default options are fine for this demo. Leave the
                hostname as "debian" and the domain name blank.</li>
            <li>Next, you'll configure the root password. Enter a password you'll remember, then confirm it.</li>
            <li>You'll also need to create a user account. Enter a name, username, and password for the user account.
            </li>
            <li>Configure the clock based on your time zone.</li>
            <li>Next, you'll need to partition the disk. For this demo, I'll choose the "Guided - use entire disk"
                option. This will automatically partition the disk for you. Choose the disk you allocated earlier. We'll
                select the "All files in one partition" option. This will create a single partition for the entire disk.
                Press enter to confirm the changes. This will load for a bit, and then you'll need to confirm the
                changes (again) by pressing enter. Here, you'll again have to confirm the changes because of course you
                do. Select "Yes" (not the default "No") and press enter.</li>
            <li>The next prompt will ask you if you want to scan aditional installation media. Select "No" and press
                enter.</li>
            <li>Next, we'll select a country, and then go through two more prompts where the default is fine. The
                installer will then start installing the base system. During this process you can opt into the Debian
                package survey if you want, or just select "No" and press enter.</li>
            <li>Next we'll install aditional software. For this demo, we don't actually need any of the options. If you
                want to install any of the options, feel free to select them, but I'll use the arrow keys and space bar
                to deselect all of the options, then press enter.</li>
            <li>This will take some time based on how many packages you selected. Once the installation is complete, the
                installer will prompt you to restart the system. Select "Continue" and press enter.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 5: Log in to Debian-12</h3>
        <p>Once the virtual machine has restarted, you'll be prompted to log in. Enter the username and password you
            created earlier. You should now be logged in to Debian-12!</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>That's it! We've successfully created a virtual Debian-12 machine using the virt-manager tool.</p>
