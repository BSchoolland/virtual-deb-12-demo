        <h2>Part 1: Creating a virtual Debian-12 machine</h2>
        <p>The first step in my project was of course to create a Debian-12 VM.  On Linux this process was not complicated.</p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>I used my linux machine for this project.</p>
        <h3>Step 1: Install virt-manager</h3>
        <p>First, I had to make sure virt manager was installed, for which I used the following commands.</p>
        <pre>
    sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-clients virt-manager  
    sudo apt install -y libvirt-daemon-system bridge-utils virtinst libvirt-daemon  
    sudo apt install -y qemu qemu-kvm qemu-system qemu-utils  
    sudo usermod -aG libvirt $(whoami)
    sudo usermod -aG libvirt-qemu $(whoami)</pre>
        <p>Note: The last two commands utilize the $(whoami) command to get the current user. You can also just enter
            your username if you want!</p>
        <h3>Step 2: Download the Debian-12 ISO</h3>
        <p>Next, I downloaded the Debian-12 ISO by visiting debian's official website at <a
                        href="https://www.debian.org/download" target="_blank">https://www.debian.org/download</a> and downloading the ISO. </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Create a new virtual machine</h3>
        
            <p>Now that I had the ISO, I opened virt-manager by running the following command in the terminal:
                <pre>
    virt-manager</pre> and clicked on the "Create a new virtual machine" button. From here I went through all the steps to create a new virtual machine.  I won't go through all the steps here as there were quite a few and most of them were really simple, but I'll highlight a few key steps.
                </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I made sure to choose my Debian ISO as the installation media</li>
            <li>I allocated more than the default resources, since I wanted the install to be fast</li>
            <li>I set my root password to "snicklefritz78" for Professor Dale :)</li>
            <li>I used the default disk partitions, beccause we'll be dealing with storage manually later on</li>
            <li>During the software selection step, I chose the SSH server, web server, and standard system utilities</li>
            <li>Finally, I took a leap of faith and left the graphical interface out during the select and install software step in an attempt to get even more used to the linux command line and rely less on GUIs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>By the end of this process, I was able to log in and run some basic commands on my new Debian-12 virtual machine, which was a great start to my project!</p>
